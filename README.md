This is my first year Software Engineering Project that includes a cw1 file that leads you toward a coursework file which contains a README.md file that showcases our team work all over the course. Two important links can be found in the README.md File, which are Coursework 1 and Coursework 2. In Coursework 1, you can find the following: Agile Methodologies based UML Diagrams with their descriptions and a Figma link that takes you to the low-fidelity prototype that our group created. Whereas, in Coursework 2 you can find all related description to JUnit Testing. The JUnit Testing Files can be found in this repository as well as all other files.

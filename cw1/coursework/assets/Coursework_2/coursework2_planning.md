## Things to remember when doing coursework
- What counts as doing a good test plan?
- What has max taught us about good git practices?
- What has max taught us about traceability?
- What has max taught us about good team code?


##### We need to do throughout:
- git milestones
- git issues
- git labels
- make branches from dev branch -> will only be working in dev branch **NOT** main

- We want to work to an issue, write tests for the test plan, make sure code comments relate to test plans, etc

##### To do and discuss in labs for 21/03/2024
- setup first milestones and issues
- figure out the work we will need to complete
- need to discuss how we will coordinate a review process using some
combination of labels, boards, templates, etc
- Consider how we will use labels to help such a process
- Make sure we have a clear plan to work after Thursday
- decide on the coding convention style
- fix git names: 
    - `git config --global user.name “your name”` 
    - `git config --global user.email “your email” `

## Coding conventions
- need to decide coding conventions


| Convention Type      | Convention Standards for Our Work |
|:---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Style of Code        |                                   |
| Content of Comments  |note who authored each test, and when, name of test,brief description of test                                  |
| Structure of Java Files |                                |
| Naming of Tests      |                                   |
